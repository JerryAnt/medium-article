    <h1>How I changed my life</h1>
    <h2>becoming a web dev</h2>

  <p>Back in 2020 a new virus spread all over the world. Working in proximity with other people
  was getting intense. With all the restrictions and government measures, I really felt the need
  to insure my safety and the safety of my family.</p>
  <h2>Working remote?! That is an idea...</h2>
  <p>At that time, I had just made a change of path in my career. I was working in the Construction industry.
  Being from a marketing background, I had felt the curiosity of working in a radically
  different environment plus I had just bought a house and I wanted to be able to build projects out of it. I also wanted to
  work out my body as sitting on a chair all day from 9to5 was not improving my shape</p>
  <p>The pandemics and the risks towards my safety at work made me think twice about my personal goals and career expectations.</p>
  <p>In the same time, a friend of mine who was very sick was looking for a medium to express and share his feelings. I had been working
  as a marketing consultant I had some experience in the maintenance of some websites. I built him
  a website on wordpress. Nothing too fancy of course but at least he had the tools he was looking for
  and felt very happy despite his illness.</p>
  <p>While I was doing the website, I had a lot of funs looking for tools, touching some html again, building the structure of the website.</p>
  <p>I thought that maybe developing websites would be a great way to move towards something I had loved without realizing it soon enough.</p>
  <p>It would completely satisfy my needs of projects building, curiosity, fun with architectures and I would even be able to do that remotely</p>
  <p>My wife told me about Le Wagon and how fun the experience seem to look and also the employability rate looked awesome</p>
  <p>So, I asked for an interview with the school to know more about the program</p>
  <p>But I was not convinced</p>

  <p>I let it soak and applied 6 months later</p>
  <p>What a fun experience indeed....</p>
  <p>After 6 months of intensive learning and applying concepts I can say that I am part of the dev team </p>
  <p>Of course I am still a newbie but I got concepts in mind, I code everyday and whenever I am stuck, I know where to look for information</p>
